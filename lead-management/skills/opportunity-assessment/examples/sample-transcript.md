## Transcript

**Interviewer**: Thanks for joining today. Can you tell me about your business?

**David**: Sure, we're Plotter Mechanix. We do large format printing and cutting services. Been in business about 8 years now. We have three full-time employees plus me, and we bring in a consultant when things get really busy.

**Interviewer**: What's your typical customer?

**David**: Mostly B2B - sign shops, marketing agencies, some direct corporate clients. They need banners, vehicle wraps, trade show displays, that kind of thing. Average order is probably around $800-1200.

**Interviewer**: Walk me through what happens when a customer reaches out.

**David**: Oh man, it's a mess honestly. They usually call my cell phone directly because that's the number they have. Sometimes they email, but I don't check email regularly - maybe once or twice a day. Sarah might catch some emails if she's not too busy with production.

**Sarah**: The biggest problem is David sends out about 20 bids a week but only follows up on maybe 2 or 3. We don't have a CRM or anything to track them. It's all in his head or on sticky notes.

**Interviewer**: Twenty bids a week? That's a lot of quoting work.

**David**: Each quote takes me probably 15-20 minutes to put together. I have an Excel sheet with pricing, but I have to manually calculate materials, labor, machine time. Then I create a PDF and email it. But like Sarah said, following up is where we fail. I know we're losing deals because of it.

**Interviewer**: How do you know if you won or lost a bid?

**David**: Honestly? We don't unless they call back to place the order. Sometimes I'll remember to check on a big one, but mostly they just disappear into the ether.

**Sarah**: I'd estimate we're probably losing at least 30% of winnable deals just from lack of follow-up. Maybe more.

**Interviewer**: That's significant. What about production scheduling?

**Sarah**: That's another pain point. We use a whiteboard in the shop to track jobs. When an order comes in, I write it on the board with the due date. But there's no real scheduling system. Sometimes we realize too late that we've overcommitted.

**David**: Last month we had to outsource three rush jobs because we didn't realize we were already booked. That cost us about $2,000 in margin we gave up to another shop.

**Interviewer**: How do customers know their order status?

**David**: They call and ask. We don't proactively update them. Sometimes they're calling because they're worried, and it turns out their job is already done and sitting here waiting for pickup. We just forgot to tell them.

**Interviewer**: What about invoicing and payments?

**Sarah**: QuickBooks for invoicing, but it's not connected to anything. I manually create each invoice after the job is done. Terms are Net 30 but probably 40% pay late. We don't have any automated reminders set up.

**Interviewer**: What would you say is your biggest challenge right now?

**David**: Time. I'm working probably 60-70 hours a week, Sarah's doing at least 50. We're busy but not efficient. I know there's money being left on the table, but I don't have time to fix the systems while also running the business.

**Sarah**: If we could just get the follow-up thing fixed, that alone would probably add $5,000-10,000 a month in revenue. These aren't cold leads - they asked for quotes. They're interested.

**Interviewer**: Any other tools or systems you're using?

**David**: Let's see... QuickBooks for accounting, Excel for pricing, Gmail for email. We have a shared Google Drive but it's a mess. Oh, and I use my personal cell for all business calls. That's pretty much it.

**Interviewer**: No CRM, project management, or communication tools?

**Sarah**: Nothing. We looked at a few CRMs but they seemed too complex for what we need. We just need something simple to track quotes and follow up automatically.

**Interviewer**: What would success look like for you in 6 months?

**David**: I'd love to reclaim 10-15 hours a week. Stop working weekends. And capture more of those quotes we're sending out. Even converting 2-3 more per week would be huge for us.

**Sarah**: For me, it's visibility. Knowing what's coming down the pipeline, what's in production, what's waiting for customer approval. Right now everything's reactive.

**Interviewer**: Budget-wise, what makes sense for a solution?

**David**: If it could genuinely save us 10+ hours a week and capture those lost deals, I'd happily pay $500-1000 a month. The ROI would be there immediately.

**Interviewer**: Any concerns about implementing new systems?

**Sarah**: Just that it needs to be simple. We don't have time for a complex rollout or extensive training. It needs to just work.

**David**: And it can't disrupt current operations. We need to keep the shop running while we improve things.

**Interviewer**: Understood. Any questions for me?

**David**: How quickly could something like this be implemented? We're heading into busy season in about 6 weeks.

**Interviewer**: For the quick wins like automated follow-up, we're typically looking at 2-3 weeks. Full system might be 6-8 weeks. We can phase it so you get value immediately.

**Sarah**: That would work. Start with the biggest pain point and build from there.

**David**: Exactly. Fix the follow-up problem first, then we can tackle scheduling and the rest.
